This repository was made to explain the project of **[Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)**:

**The comments in the codes are in PT-BR**
## Objectives:
- Simple database separating classes.

## Main libraries used:
- Pandas,Numpy ,Matplotlib, Sklearn, Seaborn.

## Stages of Code Development:
- Importation and Familiarization with the Dataset.
- I noticed early on that class 0 could be easily separated, but classes 1 and 2 were closer together.
- After removing class 0 and comparing only classes 1 and 2, I used the decision tree method for separation.

## Results and Submission on Kaggle.
- I used various metric parameters to assess the accuracy of the method, including Recall, Accuracy, Precision, and the confusion matrix, ensuring minimal error in all cases.
